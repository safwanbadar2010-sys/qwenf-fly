# üîß Fix Railway Deployment - "Train Has Not Arrived" Error

## ‚ùå Current Error Explained

The "train has not arrived at the station" error means:
- Railway deployment started but configuration is incomplete
- Environment variables might be missing
- Domain might not be properly set up
- Build or start command might have issues

---

## ‚úÖ **COMPLETE FIX - Follow These Steps**

### **Step 1: Go to Railway Dashboard**

1. Open your browser
2. Go to: https://railway.app
3. Login to your account
4. Find your `qwenfly` project
5. Click on it

---

### **Step 2: Check Deployment Status**

1. Look at the **Deployments** tab
2. Check if the latest deployment shows:
   - ‚úÖ **Success** (green) - Good!
   - ‚ùå **Failed** (red) - Need to fix
   - üü° **Building** (yellow) - Wait for it

---

### **Step 3: Add Missing Environment Variables**

Click on **Variables** tab in Railway dashboard.

**Add these if missing:**

| Variable Name | Value |
|--------------|-------|
| `MONGODB_URI` | `mongodb+srv://qwenfly:Wd9AIAr623wWjCM4@qwenfly-cluster.kpz94eq.mongodb.net/travel-booking?retryWrites=true&w=majority` |
| `JWT_SECRET` | `qwenfly_super_secret_jwt_key_2024` |
| `FLIGHT_API_KEY` | `68fd119661ff8c44dc9282a8` |
| `HOTEL_API_KEY` | `68fd19f9017cce84938927c8` |
| `FLIGHT_API_BASE_URL` | `https://api.flightapi.io` |
| `HOTEL_API_BASE_URL` | `https://api.makcorps.com` |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` |
| `PORT` | `${PORT}` *(Railway auto-sets this)* |

**Click "Add" after each variable**

---

### **Step 4: Generate Domain**

1. Go to **Settings** tab
2. Scroll to **Domains** section
3. Click "**Generate Domain**"
4. Railway will give you a URL like: `qwenfly-production.up.railway.app`
5. **Copy this URL** - this is your API endpoint!

---

### **Step 5: Redeploy**

After adding variables:

1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click "**Redeploy**" on latest deployment
3. **OR** Click "**Deploy**" button
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment

---

### **Step 6: Check Logs**

1. Click on the latest deployment
2. Click "**View Logs**"
3. Look for:
   ```
   ‚úÖ MongoDB connected successfully
   Server running on port XXXX
   ```

4. If you see errors, read them and fix accordingly

## üîß **Alternative: Redeploy from Terminal**

If Railway dashboard doesn't work, use CLI:

### **Method 1: Full Redeploy**

```cmd
cd c:\Users\RR\OneDrive\Desktop\QwenFly

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Link to your project
railway link

# Set environment variables
railway variables set MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://qwenfly:Wd9AIAr623wWjCM4@qwenfly-cluster.kpz94eq.mongodb.net/travel-booking?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

railway variables set JWT_SECRET="qwenfly_super_secret_jwt_key_2024"

# Deploy
railway up
```

### **Method 2: Check Status**

```cmd
# View logs
railway logs

# Get domain
railway domain

# Check variables
railway variables
```

---

## üêõ **Common Issues & Fixes**

### **Issue 1: "Module not found" in logs**

**Solution:**
```cmd
# Add package.json to root if not there
# Make sure railway.json has: "buildCommand": "cd server && npm install"
```

### **Issue 2: "PORT already in use"**

**Solution:**
- Railway auto-assigns PORT
- Don't set PORT to a fixed number
- Use: `const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;`
- ‚úÖ Already correct in your code!

### **Issue 3: "MongoDB connection failed"**

**Solution:**
1. Check MONGODB_URI is set in Railway variables
2. MongoDB Atlas ‚Üí Network Access ‚Üí Add `0.0.0.0/0`
3. Verify connection string is correct

### **Issue 4: "No domain found"**

**Solution:**
1. Railway Settings ‚Üí Domains
2. Click "Generate Domain"
3. Wait 30 seconds
4. Refresh page

## üß™ **Test Your Deployment**

Once deployed successfully:

### **1. Health Check**
```
https://YOUR-RAILWAY-DOMAIN.up.railway.app/api/health
```

```json
{"status":"OK","timestamp":"...","service":"Travel Booking API"}
```

### **2. Flight Search**
```
https://YOUR-RAILWAY-DOMAIN.up.railway.app/api/flights/search?from=NYC&to=LAX&departureDate=2025-12-25&passengers=1
```

### **3. Hotel Search**
```
https://YOUR-RAILWAY-DOMAIN.up.railway.app/api/hotels/search?cityId=126693&checkIn=2025-12-25&checkOut=2025-12-26&rooms=1&guests=2
```
